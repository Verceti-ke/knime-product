KNIME SDK
============================================================

Quickstart guide:
- Extract the archive (if you read this here, you likely already did so).
- Launch eclipse.exe to start the Eclipse IDE, select a workspace directory
  in the workspace prompt and continue from there.


How to get additional features:
  KNIME allows for an easy integration of new features. These often 
  come under a different license and therefore are not included in 
  this archive. For example an R integration feature 
  (http://www.r-project.org) and a chemistry feature (using the chemistry
  development kit, CDK, http://cdk.sf.net/) are available. These features
  are installed via the KNIME update site. In Eclipse select 
  "Help", "Software Updates", "Find an Install". The Update Wizard 
  opens; select the features you want to install now from the KNIME category.
  If you select a feature and receive an error about a configuration problem, 
  click the "Select Required" button. This automatically selects all required 
  features. You need to restart Eclipse after installing new extensions in order 
  to get them activated.

  Note, the update site is also available as zip archive for a later offline
  installation. Refer to the knime.org website for details.
