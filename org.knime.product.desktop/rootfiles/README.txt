KNIME Product
============================================================

Quickstart guide:
- Extract the archive (if you read this here, you likely already did so).
- Under Windows launch knime.exe, for Linux use knime (either double
  click in a file browser or execute it in a shell)
- KNIME will open and prompt for a workspace directory, where it will put 
  its project files. It will create an empty workflow in the selected 
  workspace so that you can immediately start assembling a workflow. 


How to get additional features:
  KNIME allows for an easy integration of new features. These often 
  come under a different license and therefore are not included in 
  this archive. For example an R integration feature 
  (http://www.r-project.org) and a chemistry feature (using the chemistry
  development kit, CDK, http://cdk.sf.net/) are available. These features
  are installed via the KNIME update site. In KNIME select 
  "File", "Update KNIME...". The Update Dialog opens; Select the 
  tab "Available Software" and select the features you want to install.
  (In case the KNIME update site doesn't show, click "Manage Sites..." and 
  select KNIME's update site.) 
  You need to restart KNIME after installing new extensions in order 
  to get them activated.

  Note, the update site is also available as zip archive for a later offline
  installation. Refer to the knime.org website for details.
